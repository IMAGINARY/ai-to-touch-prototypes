# ai-to-touch-prototypes

This repository contains several prototypes of applications for AI workshops and exhibitions.
Many of the applets can be launched in different modi, which are parameterized through URLs.

## Index through applauncher
A way to obtain an index is to use the [applauncher2 of IMAGINARY](https://github.com/IMAGINARY/applauncher2).
To install the applauncher for this collection, check out the repository via git, run `install.sh` and serve the repository root via a web server.


## ready-to-use URLs for several applets

The applets can be opened directly on [githack.com](https://raw.githack.com/).
